## What?
### What are we going to make?
A software that allows an end-user to remotely give a destination to a personal or commercial vehicle in order to either summon it, or send it between two locations.
## Why?
### Why are we going to make it?
The main objective of this software is to solve the issues surrounding the scarcity of time as a currency provided by humans into the operability of systems.
This also contributes to achieving our goal to utilize and expand on the technology surrounding self driving vehicles, to add useful and robust functionalities that will make future everydaylife a bit more convenient.
### What problem does it solve?
With this software, our team hopes to develop a solution that provides the end-user with more free time, which could be spent on multitasking, or completing other objectives.
The software would solve the issue of spending time collecting a vehicle from a known or unknown location in order to use it. It could also be applied to situations where products or people need to be delivered from one point to another, but a human driver is unavailable.
A concrete example of this would be the current covid-19 crisis, where public transport systems as well as logistic systems in different parts of Sweden/the world have had to lower their capacity due to their drivers taking sick leave.
